The satellite is composed of eleven PCBs in total: five horizontally stacked inside, one on top of the other; and six covering each outside face of the cube. The KiCad schematics and board designs, as well as the gerber files for each are released in Boards . The recommended manufacturing option is to print the boards and solder the components at specialized companies, since there are multiple components in each board, some of them with different maximum temperature, in very reduced size or in need of a reflow oven. This section will only mention the primary components and their references, discarding stack connectors and power regulation (present in all), reset and boot switches and status LEDs (present in some). Inside boards The first group is divided in main board, camera board and battery boards. Main board The main board contains the ATSAMD51J19A main microcontroller and MAX706 external watchdog timer, BNO085 IMU sensor and magnetorquer drivers, PCF8523 Real Time Clock, RFM98 radio module for 433 MHz LoRa communication, a USB-C connector for side power, flashing and communicating and SD Card connector for data logging. Camera board The camera board, as the name tells, holds the OV5640 camera, the STM32H743VI camera microcontroller, an SD Card connector for image savings, and a USB-C connector, for the same reasons as the main board. The camera ribbon cable is placed on the desired connector and should be fixed in the center square with tiny quantities of epoxy. Battery boards Two LP603443 batteries present in the satellite are placed between the three battery boards, wired in parallel for improved capacity, each with 3.7 V and 3.15 Wh. The circuitry is capable of sensing the current drawn and measuring its voltage. Outside boards In all six solar boards (Figure 7), there are 14-turn coils serving as magnetorquers, 42 solar cells (KXOB25-05X3F) spread by the available space, energy harvesting systems, as well as OPT3001 sunlight sensors. There is also the antenna and burn wires, for its deployment, in one of the faces. Also, at the bottom one, there are two position switches that cut the battery power when pressed, preventing power draining during testing and storing. It has also a hole in the center, enabling the camera to take visible pictures. In all solar boards, there is a 0 \u03a9 resistor that is responsible for defining the correct I2C bus assignment. For negative axis boards, this SMD type wire pulls the I2C line to ground, while in positive boards, it should pull to power. You can also check some important voltage potential values, such as (B)attery, (G)roud, (S)olar panels and (3).3 V, in the holes near the board edges. +X, -X, +Y boards These boards are equal, composed of eight solar cells each. -Y board This board, besides the eight solar cells, holds two position switches that cut the battery power when pressed, preventing power draining during testing and storing. It has also a hole in the center, enabling the camera to take pictures. +Z board This board holds the two holes needed for the USB-C connectors in main and camera boards, besides the six solar cells. -Z board This board, besides the four solar cells, holds the antenna, which is holded in place with fishing line tied to each burn wire.","title":"Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)"},{"location":"2.%20Satellite/2.2.%20Engineering%20unit/2.2.1.%20Hardware/2.2.1.1.%20Printed%20circuit%20boards/#printed-circuit-boards-pcbs","text":"The PCBs are the fundamental hardware of the PyCubed-Mini, as they are precisely designed to hold its required components, as well as their connections, being that external, with USB-C connectors to easily interface with a computer or internal ones: between components in the same board, through the middle of it; or between board with stack connectors, with data and power lines.

What you need Tape measure and burn wire ; Brackets, nylon screws and nuts ; 3M DP2216 epoxy or similar, with apply gun; Cardboard/PVC tube, with around 1 meter; Velcro tape with adhesive; u.FL male cable; Dremel tool; Soldering iron and solder; Cutting and drilling pliers; Sandpaper; Step 1: Prepare and place the tape Grab the referenced tape measure, get it out of the rolling box and cut at least two strips of around 20 cm each, making sure they are the same size; With a Dremel tool, remove around 3 cm from one of the sides of each strip to create an electrically conductive and solderable region; TIP: be extremely precise in removing all the paint around the edge to improve solderability. At the recently scraped region, from about 1 cm of the tip, bend the strip 90 degrees to form a crease; Solder the creased tips of two strips to the antenna pads on the -Z board. NOTE: the soldering step must happen right after the scraping and bending due to oxidation issues on the strip. Step 2: Prepare and place the burn wire Cut at least two burn wire pieces of aroung 3 cm each; Pass them through the specified holes, keeping the center of the wire, and the majority of its length, on the same side of the antenna strips; On the other side, bent the necessary to keep it in place, solder both contact points and cut the excedent wire. Step 3: Attach the antenna brackets After printing the brackets, place each between the antenna and the board, with the inclination touching the strip and its openings matching the board holes; Place a M2 nylon screw from the top through the bracket opening and the board hole, securing it with a corresponding nylon nut on the bottom side; Step 4: Tune the antenna Grab a 1 m cardboard/PVC tube and place the antenna board on one end and the VNA on the other, with velcro tape with adhesive, and connect the two (an adapter from u.FL to SMA connectors may be needed); NOTE: the tube creates a safe distance between the parts, in terms of eletromagnetic interference With the VNA, measure the initial frequency, resistance and reactance of the antenna. The desired values are around 433 MHz, 50 \u03a9 and 0 \u03a9, respectively. Disconnect the antenna from the VNA; For tuning the frequency, since it has an initial value below the desired, cut around 5 mm in each strip; Connect the antenna again and check the frequency; TIP: each 5 mm cut should decrease in aroung 10 MHz, however it is still recommended to cut that size at a time and remeasure Repeat the last three points until the value is close to the desired, then reducing the cutting size to only 1 mm (or less); For tuning the reactance, adjust the position of the brackets by sliding them. Overall, widing the antenna will increase its reactance, narrowing will decrease it; Step 5: Final procedures Make sure you achieved the desired antenna parameters before proceeding; Make a 1 mm in diameter hole on the center of the outter edge (about 3 mm from the tip) of the antenna strips with a hole punch pliers, and sand it; Apply a good amount of epoxy on the sides of the brackets to fix it in position. Make sure the epoxy does not escape the board surface, neither touches the antenna strip or the nylon screw; Leave the board in a safe place to dry for about a day, and later remove the nylon pieces.
