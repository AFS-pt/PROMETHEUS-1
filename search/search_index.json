We also give some tips and useful notes for the process, learnt from this and previous builds at Carnergie Mellon University, where it was originally created and developed through multiple revisions.</p> <p>During the development of a space mission, there are usually two separate units to build: an Engineering Unit and a Flight Unit.

After, there will be some single testing of that parts, followed by the final assembly steps, for completing the stack, and final checking procedures.</p> <p>This guide follows a sort of chronological order to facilitate its following, yet advised to fully read it first to avoid mistakes during the procedure.</p> <p>For better readibility, check the Docs folder for each Readme file.</p>"},{"location":"2.%20Satellite/2.2.%20Engineering%20unit/2.2.1.%20Hardware/2.2.1.1.%20Printed%20circuit%20boards/","title":"Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)","text":"<p>The PCBs are the fundamental hardware of the PyCubed-Mini, as they are precisely designed to hold its required components, as well as their connections, being that external, with USB-C connectors to easily interface with a computer or internal ones: between components in the same board, through the middle of it; or between board with stack connectors, with data and power lines.</p> <p>The satellite is composed of eleven PCBs in total: five horizontally stacked inside, one on top of the other; and six covering each outside face of the cube.
