# Unitary testing

By unitary testing, we refer to simple tests that can and should be made before assembling an entire unit. These can detect some errors or damages when testing individuals systems, for example, on communication or board detections. In this chapter, there are some detailed steps and expected results to be achieved during this type of testing.
