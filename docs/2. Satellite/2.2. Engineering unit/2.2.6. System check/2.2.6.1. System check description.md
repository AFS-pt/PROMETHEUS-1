# System check

This chapter describes the software application used for testing and validating the satellite's payload and core functioning. As it was expressed previously in chapter [Unitary testing: Mainboard payload](#mainboard-payload), the same code is used to now verify all eight tasks available. Also, if the unitary testing was performed, a detailed console log with its performance was noticeable, where some success criteria needed to be achieved in each trial to pass.

- SD card test: It displays if the SD card is detected or not;

- IMU test: Detects if IMU is functional and retrieve some accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer readings;

- Sun sensor test: Shows if all six sun sensors are functional and display some light intensity measurements;

- Coil driver test: Runs the drivers with three different voltage inputs, generating proportional magnetic fields with the driving current;

- Burn wire test: Applies a PWM signal (default duty-cycle is 0.3% for 3 secs) to the burn wire to validate the deploy mechanism;

- I2C test: Scans all integrated circuits and solar boards connected to the multiple I2C buses;

- NVM reset and test: Defaults the NVM counter and checks if its operation is right (requires the SD card);

- Current sensor test: Measures the current over a short period of time and looks for spikes or other anomalies that can translate in bad power supply;
