# Antenna

When simplicity and flexibility are two major parameters when designing an foldable antenna for this satellite, conductive tape measure comes in hand to develop a feasible solution.

<br />

## Antenna strips

As mentioned before, the satellite antenna, composed of two tape measure strips, is soldered to the defined Z- board pads. The metallic tape measure required for the process must be of approximately 1 cm in width, be almost planar and if possible, made of a easy-soldable material. The tape reference used for the assembly was DEXTER 8MM.

## Fishing line

The fishing line used for passing through the tape measure strip hole and the burn wire must be multithreaded, as each thread is smaller, they are melted easier when current passes through the burn wire. The line reference used for the assembly was CAPERLAM 4X 0.16 mm.

## Burn wire

The burn wire is made of nickel and chrome alloy of size AWG30.
