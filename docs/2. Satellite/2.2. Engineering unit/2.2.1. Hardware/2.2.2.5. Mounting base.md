# Mounting base

The mounting base is 3D-printed from PLA to provide a stable and safe piece to the satellite be placed on. Also it helps to place it on a flat surface and to hold it without pressing any components. The sliding required to insert the satellite facilitates the trigger of the switch mechanism stated previously.

The 3D model is released in [Fixtures](/2.Satellite/Hardware/Fixtures).
