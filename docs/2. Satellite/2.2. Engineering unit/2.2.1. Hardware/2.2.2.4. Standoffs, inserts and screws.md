# Standoffs, inserts and screws

There are three major types of mechanical parts required for the satellite, mentioned in the subtitle. They are recommended to be made of brass, since it has low density, or alluminum alternatively for the same reason.

<br /> 

## Standoffs

First, the standoffs separate each inside board with the adequate space between them. There were two sizes used: 6 mm and 4 mm in length, with eight M3 units needed for each size.

<br /> 

## Heat inserts

Then, the heat inserts, as referred before, provide the screwthreads needed for securing the external boards to the internal stack. There are needed 24 units in total: 4 units of M3, for attaching the -Y board to the stack; and 20 units of M2, for attaching X, +Y and Z boards.

<br /> 

## Screws

Finally, the screws fix the boards mentioned above, therefore, it is needed: 4 units of M3 (4 mm) for screwing -Y board to the -Y rail; 4 units of M3 (6 mm) screws for +Y rail to the stack; and 20 units of M2 (5 mm) screws for X, +Y and Z boards.
