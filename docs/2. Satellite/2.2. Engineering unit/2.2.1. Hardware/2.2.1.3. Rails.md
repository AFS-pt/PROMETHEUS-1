# Rails

Rails are the structural supports of the stack. There are two pieces in each stack, on the top and on the bottom, in which they hold inserts, sorted by the 3 axis. They provide the screwthreads needed for securing each external panels, as well as the upper and lower internal ones.

They are usually build from 3D-printed polylactic acid (PLA), since it is a cheap, simple and effective solution for granting the required rigidity for a testing unit.

Also made from PLA, two small brackets are needed for adjusting the antenna strips angle, holded in place with two M2 screws and nuts of nylon.

The 3D models of each rail and brackets are released in [Mechanical Structure](https://github.com/AFS-pt/PROMETHEUS-1/blob/main/2.Satellite/1.Hardware/Mechanical_Structure).
