### Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)

The PCBs are the fundamental hardware of the PyCubed-Mini, as they are precisely designed to hold its required components, as well as their connections, being that external, with USB-C connectors to easily interface with a computer or internal ones: between components in the same board, through the middle of it; or between board with stack connectors, with data and power lines.

The satellite is composed of eleven PCBs in total: five horizontally stacked inside, one on top of the other; and six covering each outside face of the cube. The KiCad schematics and board designs, as well as the gerber files for each are released in [Boards](/2.Satellite/Hardware/Boards). The recommended manufacturing option is to print the boards and solder the components at specialized companies, since there are multiple components in each board, some of them with different maximum temperature, in very reduced size or in need of a reflow oven.

This section will only mention the primary components and their references, discarding stack connectors and power regulation (present in all), reset and boot switches and status LEDs (present in some).

#### Inside boards

The first group is divided in main board, camera board and battery boards.
