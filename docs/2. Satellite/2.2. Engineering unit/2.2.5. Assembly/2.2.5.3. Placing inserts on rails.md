# Placing inserts on rails

This chapter will describe how to correctly place the heat inserts into the rails.

<br /> 

## What you need

- [Inserts](#heat-inserts);

- [Rails](#rails);

- M2 and M3 drilling machine;

- Soldering iron;

- Sandpaper:

<br />

## Step 1: Place the inserts

- Mount and tightly secure the M3 drill;

- Grab the printed rails and fix them on a vise;

- Drill the four M3 holes on the corners of the -Y board to remove imperfections;

*TIP: with the drill not rotating, align it with hole and then run it.*

- Repeat the above with a M2 drill in the remaining holes of both boards;

- Turn on the soldering iron at 275 ÂºC (slighty above the polymer melting point) and let it heat;

- Select the right insert for each hole and figure out its orientation;

*TIP: check the figure to find out the correct orientation.*

- From the outside perspective of the satellite, place each insert on top of the hole and push it down the rail with the iron, until the insert is totally inside;

*TIP: make sure it goes down slowly and straight as the plastic melts.*

<br /> 

## Step 2: Final procedures

- Sand the remaining material off the hole margins and interiors;

- Check if the standoffs and screw can be easily fixed;

- Check if the camera board can be placed on -Y rail and, if needed, sand the side wall to allow it;
