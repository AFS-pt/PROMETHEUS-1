# Software description

After installing the firmware on the main and camera boards, some [Unitary testing](#unitary-testing) could be made to validate if everything is working as supposed, in an initial stage, or upload the code to run during launch and flight. To do so, some software applications must be built, in order to run files in our board(s). 

There are some already built and useful unitary testing scripts released in [Tests](https://github.com/AFS-pt/PROMETHEUS-1/blob/main/2.Satellite/3.Software/Tests), which will be mentioned in the next chapter. However, the Python software files for flight and system check are released in [Flight](https://github.com/AFS-pt/PROMETHEUS-1/blob/main/2.Satellite/3.Software/Flight), which require a build first, detailed right below. 

Based on [RExLab tutorial](https://pocketqube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building.html):

> The frame folder contains the main.py (entry point for our software) and a custom state machine implementation.
>
> The drivers folder contains libaries allowing one to interface with the target hardware. We currently have the example emulator, pycubedmini driver and pycubedmini emulation.
>
> The applications folder contains the programs that utilize the drivers to achieve the specific mission objective. It contains the state machine configuration and tasks such as detumbling, beacon transmisions, logging and power management.
