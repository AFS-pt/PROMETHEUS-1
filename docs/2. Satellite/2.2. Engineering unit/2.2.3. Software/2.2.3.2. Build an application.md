# Build an application

## What you need

- Bash console;
  
- Flight software;  
  
> - python3
>
> - numpy
> 
> - ImageMagick
> 
> - graphviz
>
> *NOTE: Numpy is used for running the emulated sattelite and is therefore not required for building. ImageMagick and graphviz are used to create a state machine diagram along with your built files.*

## Step 1: Run the script

> To build the flight software you run:
> 
> ```bash
> $ sh build.sh {driver} {application}
> ```
>
> The {driver} is the part of the software that interfaces with the hardware (or emulates it).
> 
> The {application} is what the software attempts to achieve the mission objective (by utilizing the driver to communicate with the hardware).
> 
> This allows us to easily test and develop flight software localy by emulating the hardware.

For example, for building system-check app, you should run:
```bash
user@machine ~/Software/Flight/state_machine
$ sh build.sh drivers/pycubedmini/ applications/system-check/
```

The build should appear at `~/Software/Flight/state_machine/build/` directory.
