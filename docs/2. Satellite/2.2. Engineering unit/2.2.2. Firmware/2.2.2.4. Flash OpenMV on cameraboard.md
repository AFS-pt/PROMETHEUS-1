# Flash OpenMV on cameraboard

## What you need

- PyCubed-Mini cameraboard;

- PC with 1 free USB port;

- USB-C cable with power and data lines;

- OpenMV IDE.

<br /> 

## Step 1: Connect the camera and plug the board

- After placing the camera on the board, connect it to your PC with the USB-C cable;

- Make sure the power switch on the board is turned on.

<br /> 

## Step 2: Flash OpenMV

- On OpenMV IDE, click on the bottom-left icon labeled as "Connect", as follow the GUI prompts;

*NOTE: There is a board switch connecting the BOOT0 pin to VDD, entering bootloader mode if asked in the GUI prompts.*

- Select "Yes" to confirm that the OpenMV camera (our cameraboard) is connected and paired;

- Select the correct board: OpenMV Cam H7 (STM32H743);

- Select "Yes" to erase internal file system;

- Unplug and plug again the USB-C cable;

- The GUI should automatically start deleting and programming the bootloader. When finished, a success message should appear;

<br /> 

## Step 3: Test the camera

- If asked to register the OpenMV camera, you can ignore pressing "No" to all prompts;

- If everything worked as planned, you should be back to the IDE code, with the `helloword.py` code file open. If that's not the case, you can open the file in IDE top-left, on `File > Examples > HelloWorld`;

- You can run this code by pressing the "Start" button on bottom-left and check the video feedback on the top-right.
