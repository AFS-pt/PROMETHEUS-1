# Firmware description

Preferably, you should skip building both the SAMD UF2 bootloader and CircuitPython files, as they are already released on [Firmware](https://github.com/AFS-pt/PROMETHEUS-1/blob/main/2.Satellite/2.Firmware), and skip to [Flashing SAMD UF2 bootloader](https://afs-pt.github.io/PROMETHEUS-1/2.%20Satellite/2.2.%20Engineering%20unit/2.2.2.%20Firmware/2.2.2.2.%20Flash%20SAMD%20UF2%20bootloader%20on%20mainboard/). However, some important references are given if you want to learn the required steps to build the [SAMD UF2 bootloader](https://github.com/PyCubed-Mini/uf2-samdx1) or [CircuitPython](https://github.com/PyCubed-Mini/circuitpython) yourself.
