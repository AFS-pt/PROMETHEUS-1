# Firmware description

Preferably, you should skip building both the SAMD UF2 bootloader and CircuitPython files, as they are already released on [Firmware](/2.Satellite/Firmware), and skip to [Flashing SAMD UF2 bootloader](#flashing-samd-uf2-bootloader). However, some important references are given if you want to learn the required steps to build the [SAMD UF2 bootloader](https://github.com/PyCubed-Mini/uf2-samdx1) or [CircuitPython](https://github.com/PyCubed-Mini/circuitpython) yourself.
